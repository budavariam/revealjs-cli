# TODO

- [x] copy referenced local files as well without opening in a browser on generation
- [x] fix CI
- [x] publish to npm
- [ ] HIGH: try out custom config values
- [ ] LOW: dev server to reload on modifications
- [ ] LOW: use a better logging strategy, err and verbose levels are not enough
- [ ] HIGH: Let the users decide whether they want a lot of ejb parser logs separate from debugMode
- [ ] HIGH: Make it clear that the folder that we're going to export in, is going to be cleared before export
- [ ] MED: Make it easier to change export location
- [ ] Add automatized version increase and publish
- [ ] Try to decrease npm package size by adding libs as a dependency instead of storing static files in the repo
